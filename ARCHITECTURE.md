# CoCoder Architecture

**Status:** v2 (rebuild) — live  
**Last verified:** 2026-06-16 (launch self-heals governance dirt — [ADR-0024](./cocoder/decisions/0024-governance-pre-run-snapshot.md); the one commit spine remains direct-to-branch, **single mode** ([ADR-0023](./cocoder/decisions/0023-workspace-commit-spine.md) Amendment 2 / failure-catalog F22); `main` is the canonical trunk and committed work is on the checked-out branch by construction)

## Mental Model

CoCoder has **three storage zones** ([ADR-0008](./cocoder/decisions/0008-repository-topology.md), amended 2026-06-10) that must never be conflated.

| Zone | Location | Tracked in git? | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Install (public)** | CoCoder clone — `packages/`, `docs/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `cocoder/` (dogfood governance) | Yes | The engine, the shipped persona/standards base, the dashboard, public docs — and the dogfood workspace's own governance |
| **Install (private)** | `<CoCoder>/local/` | **Never** (only its signage `README.md` is tracked) | ALL machine-local state, spanning every managed workspace: the operational DB, run artifacts, per-run worktrees, workspace definition files (`local/workspace/`), settings, secrets, audit logs — survives `git pull` |
| **Workspace (tracked)** | `<primary-root>/cocoder/` | Yes (committed to that repo) | That workspace's governance: priorities, decisions, tickets, memory, standards extensions, persona extensions — community-visible |

**There is no per-workspace "local" zone.** A `cocoder/` governance directory is fully git-tracked
and never contains machine state; everything machine-specific lives in the install's one `local/`.

### The dual nature (CoCoder building itself)

The CoCoder repo is two things at once: the **engine install** every workspace shares, and the host
of one particular workspace — the **dogfood**, whose primary root is CoCoder itself. So
`<CoCoder>/cocoder/` is simply the dogfood workspace's governance directory, structurally identical
to the `cocoder/` directory any managed repo gets. For the dogfood, "product decisions" and "build
decisions" are the same set, so they share one `cocoder/decisions/` tree. An adopter's repo carries
*their* product's ADRs in *their* `cocoder/decisions/`; CoCoder's ship here.

### Multi-machine sync

`local/` is not in git, but it **lives inside your CoCoder folder**. Sync the CoCoder directory across machines the same way you sync any dev environment (Syncthing, iCloud Drive, a private dotfiles repo, etc.). Git updates the engine; your sync tool keeps `local/` aligned across laptops.

## How work reaches trunk — the commit spine (ADR-0023)

There is exactly **one** way tracked files reach the active workspace branch: the **commit spine**, a
single `core` service every actor calls — Oscar's wrap edits, Bob's verified atom, Deb's repair, Oz's
repair, the daemon's priority/persona/governance mutations, and any founder-directed edit. No actor
reimplements `git commit`. (This replaces the three divergent commit paths the 2026-06-14 audit found —
`runCommitGate`, `commitGovernance`, `gateCommitRepair` — which is what had been stranding work.)

There is exactly **one mode** (ADR-0023 Amendment 2, founder directive 2026-06-15 — the opt-in isolation
lane was removed). The spine always: works on the **active checkout / active branch** (no worktree, no run
branch, no landing step); commits **everything the actor changed** in one commit — the
[ADR-0007](./cocoder/decisions/0007-write-scope-enforcement.md) allow-list is **advisory**, out-of-lane
paths are committed and **flagged**, never withheld; applies **verification in place** for code; and emits
**one durable receipt** (commit-link + event: branch, SHA(s), changed files, out-of-lane flagged files,
verification evidence).

**Launch self-heals governance dirt ([ADR-0024](./cocoder/decisions/0024-governance-pre-run-snapshot.md)).**
The direct-mode launch guard partitions uncommitted in-scope files by owner: **builder/product** dirt
(`packages/**`) still **refuses** the launch (protecting the founder's product WIP), but **governance-only**
dirt (the `cocoder/**` / docs / `ARCHITECTURE.md` surfaces) is auto-committed as a single
`governance: pre-run snapshot` through the spine and the launch proceeds. So authoring a priority and
immediately launching it can never be blocked by the governance edit it just made (the run_91–96 strand
class). Mixed dirt refuses and snapshots nothing.

| Change kind | Path | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Governance / docs / ADRs / priorities / personas / standards | **Direct to the active branch** — commit in place | light / none (can't break a build) |
| Product / machinery **code** | **Direct to the active branch**, but the orchestrator verifies *before* the spine commits (per-atom diff + tests); fail → revert that atom in place, commit nothing | risk-matched ([ADR-0013](./cocoder/decisions/0013-orchestration-observation.md)) |
| Shared GitHub repo | The founder checks out a feature branch; the engine commits to it and `git push`es (**non-gating**). The merge to the shared `main` is GitHub's **PR review**, not the engine's | per the repo's CI / PR gate |

**Why this is safe with one mode:** the single-writer-per-workspace lock
([ADR-0004](./cocoder/decisions/0004-process-architecture.md)) serializes all writes, so in-place
quarantine (`restoreToHead`) can only ever touch the one actor's own uncommitted work; and "git is the
undo." **Why it ends the drift for good:** there is no run branch on *any* path — so no off-trunk place for
committed work to strand. The F14/F17/F19/F20/**F22** strand class is gone by construction. There is no
`pending-landing`, no held-back queue, no manual recovery: work commits to the checked-out branch, always.

## Why Git Will Not Destroy User Preferences

Git only modifies **tracked** files. Ignored paths are invisible to `git pull`, `git checkout`, and `git merge`. CoCoder's safety relies on a small ignore matrix that two different repositories (the CoCoder install repo and your application repo) both enforce.

### Ignore matrix (canonical)

| Repo | Path | Status | Owner of the rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CoCoder install** (this repo) | `/local/` | Ignored (`/local/*` + `!/local/README.md` — only the signage README is tracked) | Root `.gitignore` in CoCoder install |
| **CoCoder install** (this repo) | `/cocoder/` | **Tracked, fully** — the dogfood workspace's governance | No rule needed; just *don't* add it to .gitignore |
| **Your application repo** (after init) | `cocoder/` | **Tracked, fully** — your workspace's governance | Same — never ignored, never contains machine state |
| Any repo | `*.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/` | Ignored at both levels | Both root and template `.gitignore` |
| Any repo | `*.example.yaml`, `*.example.json` | **Tracked** (public reference samples) | Explicit allow — never add example files to ignore rules |

**Rule of thumb:** the install's `/local/` is the *only* private zone, period. Everything in a
`cocoder/` governance directory — priorities, decisions, tickets, memory, standards, persona
extensions — is tracked and community-visible. If a tool proposes ignoring anything outside the
install's `local/`, refuse.

### Pattern

1. Ship **example** files as `*.example.*` (tracked); real config lives in `local/` (untracked).
2. On init/bootstrap, copy `templates/workspace-cocoder/` → `<primary-root>/cocoder/`; nothing
   machine-local is ever written into the workspace.
3. On CoCoder self-update: `git pull` updates `packages/` and `templates/`; `local/` is invisible to
   git and survives untouched.

## Persona Boundaries (CoCoder)

| Persona | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| **Oz** | Cross-workspace runs, settings, launch/stop, health — not product code |
| **Oscar** | Product priority orchestration inside one workspace |
| **Ian** | Ops/backoffice queue — CRM, copy, integrations |
| **Bob** | Implementation, architecture, ADRs for product code |
| **Talia** | Test layer — writes/runs automated tests, fixes failures, reports evidence |
| **Quinn** | Experience layer — exercises the running product like a user (browser/UI/scripts) |
| **Phil** | Custom/extension pattern — domain "primitives" on any project |

## Play system

A **Play** is a typed orchestration contract, not just markdown pasted into a prompt. The taxonomy owner
is [ADR-0010](./cocoder/decisions/0010-taxonomy-and-authoring.md): execution model is either
prompt-only or hybrid, and trigger class is lifecycle-triggered, persona-requested, or
tool/API-triggered. The schema owner is
[`packages/core/src/plays/types.ts`](./packages/core/src/plays/types.ts), which defines the contract
metadata surface: `executionModel`, `triggerClass`, `purpose`, `allowedCallers`, `inputSchema`,
`outputValidator`, `deterministicStep`, `commitMode`, `requiredCheckpoints`, and `writeScope`.

Prompt-only Plays run the Play body through the assigned CLI/model. Hybrid Plays add an optional
deterministic precheck/gate before that LLM layer. The execution owner is
[`packages/core/src/plays/dispatch.ts`](./packages/core/src/plays/dispatch.ts): a `deterministicStep.ref`
is a repo-root-relative script path, `.mjs` refs run through Node, other refs run as executable files,
refs may not escape the repo root, and captured output either gates the Play (non-zero exit means no LLM
invocation) or feeds the Play prompt under the deterministic precheck section.

Launch prompts receive a compact per-persona capability manifest, not every Play body. The manifest
owner is [`packages/core/src/plays/manifest.ts`](./packages/core/src/plays/manifest.ts): it renders the
visible Play id, purpose, caller, trigger, input, write behavior, and mandatory/optional status for that
persona. Full Play bodies stay lazy-loaded and enter the prompt only at dispatch.

Optional Play requests use a typed handoff lane. The validation owner is
[`packages/core/src/plays/request.ts`](./packages/core/src/plays/request.ts): it parses the handoff and
validates caller, Play id, mandatory-vs-optional availability, required input schema, and returned write
scope. Per-persona CLI/model assignment is resolved by runner/daemon dispatch plumbing, such as
[`packages/daemon/src/launcher.ts`](./packages/daemon/src/launcher.ts). Mandatory lifecycle/policy
triggers are not persona discretion; the registry owner is
[`packages/core/src/plays/triggers.ts`](./packages/core/src/plays/triggers.ts), with daemon launch wiring
and runner wrap-up dispatch in [`packages/core/src/runner/runner.ts`](./packages/core/src/runner/runner.ts).

Output validation is selected by the Play's declared `outputValidator.ref`. The production selector is
the exported `validatePlayOutput` in [`packages/core/src/runner/runner.ts`](./packages/core/src/runner/runner.ts);
for example, the wrap-up Play declares `validators/founder-closeout`, and the runner derives validation
from that ref instead of hardcoding a wrap-up-only path. The founder closeout label contract itself is
not duplicated here; its owner/consumer map lives in
[`docs/orchestration-contract-ownership.md`](./docs/orchestration-contract-ownership.md).

Plays are one-level procedures: no recursive Play delegation, no `PlayAssignment[]` multi-binding, and no
full Play-body injection into every prompt. ADR-0010 preserves that boundary and points back to the
[dispatch-boundary archive](./cocoder/priorities/archive/play-dispatch-boundary.md) as historical
context. The real-path proof is [`scripts/proof-hybrid-play.mjs`](./scripts/proof-hybrid-play.mjs): it
exercises the shipped dispatch path with a real deterministic script, a real LLM invocation for a hybrid
Play, the deterministic gate case where no LLM is invoked, and the runner-owned wrap-up trigger validated
through the declared `outputValidator.ref`.

## Oz vs Debugger

CoBuilder's **ORCH DEBUGGER** binds to one run, collects evidence, launches Codex for orchestration repair. **Oz** generalizes that into:

- Registry of all workspaces and runs (isolated tmux namespace per workspace — see Multi-workspace below)
- Interactive dashboard (launch priority, model map, concurrency flags)
- Run Inspector (debugger evidence views)
- Settings editor for global + per-workspace overrides

The Oz daemon owns run state and evidence without forking the engine's business logic — it drives `packages/core` through the `SessionHost`/adapter ports rather than reimplementing orchestration.

## Package topology and dependency rule

The v2 rebuild is a clean build (not an extraction): the six packages already exist under `packages/`. Per [`cocoder/decisions/0008-repository-topology.md`](./cocoder/decisions/0008-repository-topology.md), dependencies flow inward only:

- `core` depends on nothing else in the workspace.
- `adapters`, `session-hosts`, and `ui` depend only on `core`.
- `daemon` and `cli` depend on `core` + `adapters` + `session-hosts`.

The rule is enforced by a deterministic guardrail: `node scripts/check-topology.mjs`.

## Language and validation policy

- **TypeScript across all packages.** Each package exports `./src/index.ts`; there is no `.mjs` orchestration core (the historical v1 `.mjs` plan does not apply to the rebuild).
- **No external validation library** (zod/yup/joi/ajv/valibot) is currently a dependency or imported anywhere; validation is hand-written TypeScript where needed.
- **pnpm workspaces**, Node per `.nvmrc`.

## Multi-workspace concurrency (plain language)

tmux names sessions globally on your Mac unless you isolate them. If Workspace A and Workspace B both create a session named `oscar-priority-foo`, they can collide.

**Fix:** give each registered workspace its own tmux *namespace* (a named socket, e.g. `cocoder-myapp`). Oz launches into that namespace. Sessions in one repo cannot see or kill sessions in another.

Analogy: one building (your Mac) with separate floors (workspace sockets) instead of everyone sharing one open-plan room (default tmux).

## Multi-machine path portability

`local/workspaces.json` registers workspaces by path. Absolute paths break across machines synced via Syncthing/iCloud if the same workspace lives at different roots (e.g. `/Volumes/NAS LOCAL/CoBuilder` vs `~/dev/CoBuilder`).

**Resolution:** workspace entries store one of:

1. A path under `${COCODER_HOME}` (the directory containing the CoCoder install) — portable as long as the install folder itself is synced.
2. A path under a named root in `local/roots.yaml` (e.g. `roots: { nas: "/Volumes/NAS LOCAL", dev: "~/dev" }`), used as `${root:nas}/CoBuilder`.

`cocoder` resolves these tokens at runtime. Absolute paths are only stored when neither token applies, and a warning is logged.

## Oz daemon security model

Oz runs an HTTP daemon that can launch and stop processes. It is **not** internet-exposed; the security posture protects against local-machine threats (untrusted browser tabs, malicious npm scripts, DNS rebinding):

1. Bind `127.0.0.1` only (never `0.0.0.0`).
2. Require a per-install session token (`local/secrets/oz-token`) on every state-changing endpoint.
3. Reject requests with mismatched `Origin`/`Host` headers (DNS-rebinding defense).
4. CSRF token required on `POST`/`DELETE` from the dashboard.
5. Settings endpoints never return secret values — only references (e.g. `"openai": "ref:env:OPENAI_API_KEY"`).
6. All launch/stop actions write to `local/audit/oz-actions.jsonl` with timestamp, persona, workspace, run id, and outcome.
7. No shell-string interpolation of workspace paths — argv arrays only.

## Oz improvement routing

Oz classifies every proposed improvement by target zone before making or recommending a change:

- `cocoder-product` — CoCoder source itself (`packages/`, `templates/`, public docs, shipped prompts + base personas). This is contributor-only developer-mode work; in the dogfood it's the portability-test call (ADR-0012).
- `workspace-shared` — the active repo's tracked `cocoder/` governance folder.
- `install-local` — the ignored `<CoCoder>/local/` machine-state zone (the only local zone).
- `upstream-candidate` — a workspace finding that may belong upstream, but should be drafted for contributor review instead of edited into the install.

Normal adopters get workspace customization by default. CoCoder product improvements are only routed to `cocoder-product` when the active workspace is the CoCoder repo dogfood workspace and developer mode is enabled. See [`cocoder/decisions/0008-repository-topology.md`](./cocoder/decisions/0008-repository-topology.md) (one-home enforcement) and [`0009-extensibility.md`](./cocoder/decisions/0009-extensibility.md).
