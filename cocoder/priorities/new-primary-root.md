> and wiring the three inert skeleton templates) — NOT an actual onboarding yet. Open with one short

> **Absorbs `workspace-onboarding` (merged 2026-06-14, priority audit).** That backlog priority is folded
> in here so there is ONE bootstrap/audit/onboarding path, not two overlapping ones. It contributed:
> the **two operated-from-Oz flows** — (a) *brand-new primary root*: init the repo + `cocoder/` zone,
> launch-ready immediately; (b) *existing-code primary root*: a full repo audit/review that **ingests
> findings into `cocoder/`** (repo instructions → `cocoder/AGENTS.md`, candidate priorities,
> architecture notes) so CoCoder starts informed; the **workspace-footprint contract** (CoCoder's ONLY
> entry into a target repo is the `cocoder/` folder; `local/` exists ONLY in the install; never a
> README); and the **CoPublisher** motivation (F12 — the first hand-scaffolded non-dogfood workspace,
> since reset, the intended first onboarding target). These flows are the concrete product surface over
> the ADR-0020 scaffold+audit machinery.

## Objective
CoCoder can onboard any primary root through **three shipped, baked-plan onboarding Playbooks**
([ADR-0020](../decisions/0020-primary-root-audit.md)), one per situation: **New Primary** (fresh/empty
root — scaffold + intake + minimal seeded governance), **CoCoder Takeover** (existing repo — the big
lift: a world-class multi-agent, founder-checkpointed audit that authors governance, never one cheap
pass), and **Drift Audit** (already-managed root — propose-only: compare governance vs reality → report
→ founder-ratify → apply). Each writes only the target's `cocoder/**`, commits via the spine (ADR-0023)
to the target's active branch, and **the founder ratifies every drafted Objective** before anything is
runnable. **Verified when:** (a) a real external repo is taken over end-to-end — scaffold → audit →
founder ratifies Objectives → first run lands, findings traceable to repo reality; and (b) a Drift Audit
runs against the dogfood and produces an honest, ratify-then-apply report. Boundary: **founder acceptance
of ADR-0020 gates any build**; no deployment, no multi-repo commit spine, no product code.

The three template **skeletons are drafted** at `packages/personas/base/playbooks/{new-primary,
cocoder-takeover,drift-audit}.md` (inert until built). They fix the phase structure, founder gates,
scopes, and outputs; the per-phase agent prompts + the loader extension + the scaffold op are the build.

Build atoms (once the ADR is accepted): wire the three Playbooks as shipped meta-Playbooks + the loader
extension (ADR-0020 §7); the `deep-read` audit Play (the Takeover P2 unit, adversarially reviewed); the
deterministic scaffold init op; and a **live Takeover proof on a real external repo** (the Phase-5 entry,
CoPublisher).
