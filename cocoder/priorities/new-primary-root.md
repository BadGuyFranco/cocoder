> and wiring the three inert skeleton templates) — NOT an actual onboarding yet. Open with one short

> launch-ready immediately; (b) *existing-code primary root*: a full repo audit/review that **ingests
> findings into `cocoder/`** (repo instructions → `cocoder/AGENTS.md`, candidate priorities,
> architecture notes) so CoCoder starts informed; the **workspace-footprint contract** (CoCoder's ONLY
> entry into a target repo is the `cocoder/` folder; `local/` exists ONLY in the install; never a
> README); and the **CoPublisher** motivation (F12 — the first hand-scaffolded non-dogfood workspace,
> since reset, the intended first onboarding target). These flows are the concrete product surface over
> the ADR-0020 scaffold+audit machinery.

## Objective
CoCoder can onboard any primary root through **three shipped, baked-plan onboarding Playbooks**
([ADR-0020](../decisions/0020-primary-root-audit.md)), one per situation: **New Primary** (fresh/empty
root — scaffold + intake + minimal seeded governance), **CoCoder Takeover** (existing repo — the big
lift: a world-class multi-agent, founder-checkpointed audit that authors governance, never one cheap
pass), and **Drift Audit** (already-managed root — propose-only: compare governance vs reality → report
→ founder-ratify → apply). Each writes only the target's `cocoder/**`, commits via the spine (ADR-0023)
to the target's active branch, and **the founder ratifies every drafted Objective** before anything is
runnable. **Verified when:** (a) a real external repo is taken over end-to-end — scaffold → audit →
founder ratifies Objectives → first run lands, findings traceable to repo reality; and (b) a Drift Audit
runs against the dogfood and produces an honest, ratify-then-apply report. Boundary: **founder acceptance
of ADR-0020 gates any build**; no deployment, no multi-repo commit spine, no product code.

The three template **skeletons are drafted** at `packages/personas/base/playbooks/{new-primary,
cocoder-takeover,drift-audit}.md` (inert until built). They fix the phase structure, founder gates,
scopes, and outputs; the per-phase agent prompts + the loader extension + the scaffold op are the build.

Build atoms (once the ADR is accepted): wire the three Playbooks as shipped meta-Playbooks + the loader
extension (ADR-0020 §7); the `deep-read` audit Play (the Takeover P2 unit, adversarially reviewed); the
deterministic scaffold init op; and a **live Takeover proof on a real external repo** (the Phase-5 entry,
CoPublisher).

## Build progress — disposition: `continue`

### Cumulative engine state (run_83 + run_86)
- ✅ **Loader extension (§7)** — core reads the three shipped Playbooks (`loadOnboardingPlaybooks`, `082fa48`)
  and the daemon offers them via a distinct `onboarding` field on `GET .../priorities`, available in every
  workspace, never copied into the repo (`70ed0e9`).
- ✅ **Scaffold primitive + live wiring (D1)** — `scaffoldCocoderZone()` create-only-copies the
  `templates/workspace-coder/cocoder/` tree with install-tree refusal (ADR-0019 §7), idempotent (`658f931`);
  `createWorkspace` now calls it via `scaffoldWorkspaceGovernance` (`735d741`, run_86). Retired the divergent
  inline `DEFAULT_ASSIGNMENTS`/`CLAUDE_POINTER`/`writeIfMissing` set. Added runtime-robust
  `installRoot()`/`workspaceTemplateDir()` (marker-climb; holds in compiled daemon). **Held back this run:**
  the three D1 template files (`personas/assignments.json`, `priorities/adhoc-session.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) —
  present in the working tree, not yet on trunk; reply `expand scope` to commit them.
- ✅ **`deep-read` audit Play** — the Takeover P2 unit, portability-clean (`4e9c98d`); hardened for first live
  use with machine-checkable findings (`axis`/`claim`/`evidence`/`confidence`), one-subsystem-per-invocation
  boundary, explicit inference labeling (`0f076ff`, run_86).

### Founder decisions (2026-06-14, run_83 wrap)
- **D1 — Scaffold reconciliation APPROVED.** Founder accepted the recommendation: the
  `templates/workspace-cocoder/` tree becomes the **single source** for the scaffolded `cocoder/` zone;
  fold the runtime-required files (`assignments.json`, adhoc priority, CLAUDE pointer) into the template,
  then wire `createWorkspace` onto `scaffoldCocoderZone`. Code wiring landed run_86; template files await
  expand-scope.
- **D2 — Live proofs DEFERRED until Oz is fully debugged.** No live onboarding/Takeover of a new
  workspace runs until Oz is fully debugged (a separate session owns that — see `oz-dashboard-bugs` +
  ticket 0006). Objective verifications (a) live external Takeover and (b) dogfood Drift Audit are
  **gated on Oz-debug-complete**. Do not attempt a live run until the founder lifts this gate.

**Remaining work:**
1. **D1 template files on trunk** — reply `expand scope` to commit the three held-back template files
   (assignments, adhoc priority, CLAUDE pointer). Required before scaffold is complete on a fresh clone.
2. **P2→P5 fan-out executor** — the launcher/runner path that runs a Takeover Playbook's phases: P1 recon →
   founder gate → P2 fan deep-read (one top-tier sub-agent per subsystem) → P3 cross-check → P4 synthesize
   `cocoder/**` → P5 founder ratify. **NOT yet designed** — today the runner only does the Oscar↔Bob directive
   loop + three hardcoded Plays (`wrap-up`, `integration-verify`, `merge-conflict` via `dispatch.ts`); there is
   NO Playbook-phase execution engine. Acceptance is a live run; **blocked on D2** for verification. Needs a
   design pass (likely ADR-0020 addendum: phase storage, P1 subsystem enumeration, founder P1/P5 gate interleave,
   deep-read top-tier model pin per ADR-0018).
3. **Live CoPublisher Takeover proof** (Phase-5 entry) — Objective verification (a). **BLOCKED on D2**.
4. **Dogfood Drift Audit run** — Objective verification (b). **BLOCKED on D2**.

**Do not relaunch this priority for build atoms** until D2 lifts or the P2→P5 executor is designed — the
bounded buildable remainder is exhausted.
