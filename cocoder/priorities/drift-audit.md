## Objective
Build the **Drift Audit** as an ordinary Oscar-driven priority: for an already-managed `cocoder/` root,
read what the governance **claims**, read the codebase **reality**, **compare**, emit a **drift report +
draft amendments/tickets**, the **founder ratifies a subset**, and only then **apply**. The audit phases
(read-claims → read-reality → compare → report) are **forbidden from writing governance**; only the
founder-ratified apply step writes `cocoder/**`; never product code (ADR-0020 Decision 5; the
`cocoder/**`-only trust boundary enforced at the commit spine, ADR-0023).

**Verified when:** a Drift run against the **CoCoder dogfood** (the first target) produces a report whose
findings each trace to a concrete governance-vs-reality mismatch, and the founder-ratified subset lands in
`cocoder/**` — i.e. Objective verification (b) of the onboarding work. **Boundary:** no product-code
writes; no new executor/runner-mode (the reframe explicitly retires that — ADR-0026); reuse the
onboard-existing engines as library tooling rather than forking a parallel contract.

The inert baked plan lives at `packages/personas/base/playbooks/drift-audit.md` (P1 read-claims → P2
read-reality → P3 compare → P4 report → P5 ratify ▸hard gate → P6 apply). It fixes the phase structure,
founder gate, scope, and outputs; the per-phase engine logic + the ordinary-priority wiring are the build.

## Reuse map (from the onboard-existing rebuild — confirm exact symbols in atom 0)
| Drift phase | Source |
|---|---|
| P2 read-reality | **Reuse** `recon`/`recon-pass` (`inventoryRepo`, `runAgenticRecon`) + deep-read fan-out (`p2-fanout` `runDeepReadSource`/`combineSourcePair`, `p2-dispatch` `resolveDeepReadAssignments`/`createDeepReadTurn`) |
| P5 ratify / P6 apply | **Reuse** `p6-apply` (materialize staged → `cocoder/**`) + the `AuditWriteBoundary`/`AuditWriteBoundaryError` at `runCommitGate` (`cocoder/**`-only, refuse-not-flag) |
| Driver + founder gates | **Reuse** the ordinary Oscar↔Bob run loop + directive/verify/wrap/resume (ADR-0010/0013); the P5 ratify is a normal Oscar wrap/verify beat, **not** an in-loop executor gate |
| **P1 read-claims** | **NEW** — pure reader of the target's `cocoder/` governance (memory/codebase-map, ADRs, priorities, standards, scopes) → claims inventory |
| **P3 compare** | **NEW** — claims-vs-reality diff → drift findings, each traceable to a concrete mismatch (stale maps, ADRs describing retired patterns, priorities referencing gone code, drifted scopes, undocumented subsystems) |
| **P4 report** | **NEW** — emit a drift report + amendment/ticket drafts (artifacts ONLY; never rewrite governance in place) |

## Proposed atom sequence (multi-session; forced green-at-every-commit; each delicate atom its own session)
0. **Owner map** — classify every onboard-existing engine as REUSE-AS-IS / ADAPT / NEW for Drift, with
   file:line evidence, and define how Drift runs as an ordinary priority (atoms call engines directly;
   gates = wrap/verify beats). Mirror run_140's `docs/onboarding-rebuild-ownermap.md`. (docs/, no product edit.)
1. **P1 read-claims engine** — pure, deterministic governance reader → `claims` inventory; refuse-on-malformed.
2. **P2 read-reality wiring** — drive `recon` + deep-read fan-out to a reality inventory (reuse, don't fork).
3. **P3 compare** — claims-vs-reality diff → traceable drift findings (non-gameable; empty inputs → empty).
4. **P4 report** — drift report + amendment/ticket drafts as artifacts (no governance writes).
5. **P5 ratify + P6 apply** — founder ratifies a subset; apply via the commit spine with the audit
   write-boundary (a path outside `cocoder/**` is REFUSED, not flagged).
6. **Runnable proof + live dogfood Drift** — a `scripts/proof-drift-*.mjs` (style of `proof-onboard-existing.mjs`)
   for the invariants, then the live dogfood Drift run (Objective verification (b)).

## Context & Evidence
- ADR-0026 reframe + the onboard-existing rebuild (run_140/141) are the template: engines kept as tooling,
  executor + phase protocol retired, founder gates as ordinary beats, `auditWriteBoundary` frontmatter on
  the onboarding priority (absent ⇒ ordinary behavior). See `new-primary-root.md` rebuild decomposition.
- **The first Drift Audit was already run by hand** — the 2026-06-14 ADR-reset + priority-audit session
  (read-claims → read-reality → compare → propose → ratify → apply) validated these exact phases. This
  build systematizes a proven flow, not an unproven one.
- New Primary + Drift adopt the same scaffold-seeded-priority delivery model as onboard-existing (ADR-0020
  §7 amendment, run_140): the shipped Drift onboarding priority would live at
  `packages/personas/base/priorities/` and be scaffold-seeded into a target — but that is an OUTPUT of this
  build, distinct from this build priority.

## Suggested Next Action
Launch a fresh run against this priority. Atom 0 = the owner map (no product edit), so the first commit is
low-risk and pins exactly what is REUSE vs NEW before any engine work begins.
